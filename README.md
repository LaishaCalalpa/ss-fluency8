## Directons

Using the JSON Placeholder [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/], create a table of users (their names and company) and print it to an HTML file. If you would like, you could add some styling, but as long as there's a table of users, it's fine! Your hint for this is to use high order functions, which will make it easy to print to the table!

Additionally, if you think you need to understand what the DOM is or how to manipulate it, I would suggest you look up YouTube videos or go back to the TreeHouse videos, where they have some practices there [https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-and-the-dom-2]
